/** Tracks, per player, which AC Source block the AC probe currently has pinned as the sweep's
 *  excitation - unlike every other probe in this mod, this one is a genuine two-step action
 *  rather than a continuously-updated pin: the first right-click (on an AC Source) just records
 *  which source to use and asks the client to show a hint; only the second right-click (on
 *  whatever point the player wants a Bode plot of, relative to that source) actually triggers the
 *  (comparatively expensive - a full complex linear solve at every swept frequency) sweep
 *  computation. The source stays pinned afterward, so a player can probe several different
 *  points against the same source without re-clicking it each time; only a shift-right-click, or
 *  clicking a different AC Source block, changes it. */
