/**
 * Charge-controlled linear-drift memristor (HP model, no boundary window function).
 * Resistance is a linear function of accumulated charge between {@code ron} and {@code roff}.
 *
 * <p>The state charge is updated one step behind the solve (this step's resistance comes from
 * last step's charge, then charge is advanced from this step's current) rather than solved
 * implicitly. That lag is negligible at the small timesteps this simulator runs at, but means
 * very large dt values can make the memristor's response ring or lag visibly.
